Date 1.15.25: so im writing this in retrospective, I remember on this day I had set up my local repo but class ended before I could create a journal, and I never got around to it. In hindsight i regret it because it would've really helped me during the project to be able to track the ideas I was getting and how I thought of implementing them at the time. Many times I would think of a way to do something for the project and then by the next class I would've forgotten how I wanted to implement it.
